# Computational-Musicology

The (initial) goal of my corpus is to analyse the similarities and differences between playlists with "Workout" in the title and with "Dance" in the title. When I read through the corpus examples on canvas, the option about workout playlists stood out to me the most initially. I found the playlist "Workout Music 2023" on spotify and used submithub.com (of which I hadn't heard previously, but which seems very useful for both this course and personal use as well) to find similar playlists. It looks through spotify playlists and finds other playlists with similar tracks and artists. Out of the top 6 results that this gave me, 3 playlists had the word "Dance" in the title. This made me interested in trying to find the similarities and differences between these types of playlists.

My first impressions are that both types of playlists mainly focus on "getting you in the mood" or "hyping you up". I expect most similarities will relate to this overlap to some extend. For the differences I'm not sure yet and I'd like to find out during the rest of the course. 

So far most tracks in the playlists seem similar to the other tracks in their own playlists (which makes sense) and I haven't found any atypical tracks yet. I hope to be able to find examples of atypical tracks when I go more in depth with the corpus.
